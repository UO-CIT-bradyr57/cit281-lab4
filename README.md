# Lab 4

## Purpose:
The purpose of this lab was to use Fastify to create different routes that respond to query inputs.

## Technologies Learned:
```markdown
- Fastify
- Node.js / npm
- git repo
```
## What I learned:
I learned how to fix MIME errors, start a git repo, and add routes with query parameters. With these changes, I could use fastify to display it on my localhost.
